## Hi, I'm AJ, thanks for stopping by!

## Rundown of What I Work With:
Languages: JavaScript/React/NextJS, Python, Rust, C, Java
Scripting: bash, shell, zsh
OS'es: Arch Linux, Proxmox, Ubuntu, Debian, Endeavour, Win10, or most any Linux Server :D
Technologies: Docker, AWS, Github (lol), Github Actions

... but I'm always open to something new! After all, you can never stop learning.

### My Mission
Currently employed as an SWE, I work across various projects with a simple mission: make them better to use,
improve their current capabilities, or bring new ideas to life.
As an avid "start a project and abandon it after a while" engineer, I found that I liked doing a bunch of things;
anything from little bug fixes to things I've never even thought about before.
You never know how an idea will do until you see it come together ... sorta like working on my motorcycle or Legos!

### Quick Fixations 
Mission aside - you'll typically find me losing my mind talking about my cats, motorcycle,
or half paying attenion because a loud vehicle peeled out within hearing distance.
