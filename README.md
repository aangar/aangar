## Hi, I'm AJ, thanks for stopping by!

### What I Work With:
- JavaScript (React, NextJS, or vanilla!)
- Python
- Docker
- Linux (Arch, Proxmox, Ubuntu, Debian, or any server :) )
- AWS
- Rust
- C
- Java

... but I'm always open to something new! After all, you can never stop learning.

### About Me
Currently employed as a SWE 1, I work across projects to try and achieve one thing - making them better.
I enjoy taking ideas and making them into a reality, and most importantly, supporting Free Open Source Software (FOSS).
After all, what better way to make awesome things than to let people modify it themselves and see what we can make?
<br/>
That aside - you'll typically find me losing my mind talking about my cats, motorcycle, or half paying attenion because a loud vehicle peeled out within hearing distance.
I got a lot of passions stored in my brain, and sometimes, they turn into rants. Welcome to my Ted Talk!
