## Hi, I'm AJ, thanks for stopping by!

### Rundown of What I Work With:
- Languages: JavaScript/React/NextJS, Python, Rust, C, Java
- Technologies: Docker, AWS, Github (lol), Github Actions
- Scripting: bash, shell, zsh
- OS'es: Arch Linux, Proxmox, Ubuntu, Debian, Endeavour, Win10, or most any Linux Server :D

... but I'm always open to something new! After all, you can never stop learning.

### About Me
Currently employed as an SWE, I work across various projects with a simple mission: make them better to use,
improve their current capabilities, or bring new ideas to life.
I typically enjoy getting thrown into new work and figuring out how it works together, I mean, what's the joy in something stale?

### Quick Fixations 
Mission aside - you'll typically find me losing my mind talking about my cats, motorcycle,
or half paying attenion because a loud vehicle peeled out within hearing distance.

### Want to Get in Contact?
